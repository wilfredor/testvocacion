# Testvocacion

A vocational test is a questionnaire or series of tests designed to help a person determine their interests, skills, and aptitudes in relation to different careers or occupations. The goal is to provide information and guidance on the career options that may be most suitable for the person, based on their strengths and personal preferences. These tests are commonly used by young people who are trying to decide which path to follow after high school, or by adults who are seeking a career change.
